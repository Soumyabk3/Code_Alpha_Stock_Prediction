# Code_Alpha_Stock_Prediction
Batch:  July: Data Science : M1

![Stock Prediction using LSTM]()

## Problem Statement

Build a machine learning model to forecast future product sales based on factors such as advertising spending, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform choice.


## Introduction

The study was effective in developing a linear regression model that can forecast future product sales based on television, radio, and print  advertising. The model's performance measures show that it is a reliable tool for projecting sales, with television advertising being the most influential component. 

Businesses can use these insights to better manage their advertising spending, prioritising the channels that generate the most sales.

## Dependencies

## Installation

To install the specified packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and ipython) and generate a requirements.txt file, follow these steps:


1. *Installing Dependencies*:

```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipython plotly 

```
and 

```bash

pip install joblib

```
 
2. *To look at the dependencies type the command on the cmd*:

```bash
pip list

```
or

```bash
   pip show numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn ipython plotly

```

3. * you can use the pip freeze command to get a list of all installed packages along with their versions*:

```bash
pip freeze

```

```bash
ipython==8.4.0
matplotlib==3.5.2
numpy==1.22.4
pandas==1.4.2
scikit-learn==1.1.1
seaborn==0.11.2
joblib==1.1.0
```

## Load the data set from Kaggle website:

## Summary
- Here we loaded Dependencies

- Data Collection: Data Loading the dataset from a CSV file

- Data Cleaning

- Data Analysis

- Data Visualization

- Feature Endgineering

- Model Building:
    The predictive model is built using scikit-learn:
    Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
    Normalizing numerical features using StandardScaler.
    Implementing a Linear Regression model.

- Model Training:
    Train the linear regression model

- Model Evaluation:
    The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as:
    Mean Squared Error (MSE)
    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
    R-squared (R²)

- Visualization of the Model Fit

- Feature Importance

- Prediction - Using the trained models to predict sales for new advertising spend inputs

## Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the steps involved in building a machine learning model for predicting sales . The thorough data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualization ensure a robust analysis, leading to more accurate predictions We developed and tested a linear regression model in Python using tools such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn. Joblib allowed for seamless model deployment. Moving forward, refining models with improved approaches promises to improve forecast accuracy, allowing organisations to optimise strategy and drive growth by making educated decisions.
